<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>At the insistence of my friend Karen, and the subtle prodding of my other friend Becca, I've finally gone about and made a professional writing website.</p>
<p>Granted, I've got no idea what I'm doing here, and this place is likely to change wildly as the days pass and I come to realize "oh Jesus, this is actually a <em>thing</em> now," and frantically rearrange the layout around in something approximating competence.</p>
<p>But we'll take it one step at a time.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you don't know me personally, which I suppose is something that could happen, I'm Matt Velez, a guy approaching the twilight years of his 20s and trying to make them count. A New Jersey native, I've been spending my adult life in Pennsylvania, out on the Philly suburbs. I haven't been writing too long, only turning serious when I was 22, but it's been a ride as fun as I could ask for.</p>
<p>I'm currently working over in Trevose, near the Jersey-Penn border, and it helps pay the bills while I vividly imagine somewhere else I'd rather be. In the four years I've been writing, I've come up with far more than I could have predicted, all of them in some stage between "hey, wouldn't it be cool if..." all the way to completed work.</p>
<p>I've dreamed of different places, different times my entire life, but it's only recently I've tried putting them to words. Sometimes I feel as if I'm behind the curve in that regard, though I can't deny I've come a <em>hell</em> of a long way since I first asked my friend on a sunny March afternoon, "how do I become more creative, anyway?"</p>
<p>Yeah, it was honestly that random. In my defense, he's a clever guy.</p>
<hr />
<p>So far, I'm intending this to be a site mostly focused on my fiction writing and my thoughts about it. Though, I've just begun web development a few days ago, and that's probably something I should be talking about, as well. I imagine, once that gets going, this place will start to serve this awkward dual role wherein I simultaneously discuss the merits of fantasy economies and how they relate to political intrigue, and then complain about why my Ruby code isn't compiling. Hopefully not in the same post!</p>
<p>Of course, being that I'm into far more than just fiction writing and programming, expect some opinionated posts on politics, gaming, modern literature, whatever I can be bothered to write a few hundred words for. I've already got a post queued up talking about my experience with Star Wars games in the mid-2000s, so yeah. That'll be a thing.</p>
<p>Can't say I know where this is all gonna take me, but I'll make sure I at least make a post once a week. Have to give off the impression I'm being active, right?</p>
<p>Not much more to say, I think. Looking forward to the future, and I hope you'll be, too.</p>
<p>First!</p>
