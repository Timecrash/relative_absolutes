<p>Wherein I detail whatever I'm working on right now.</p>
<p>This can change on a week by week basis, generally; I can be pretty scatterbrained when it comes to my writing. On the whole, though, there's a few major projects I'll be working on throughout the year, and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Witch and the Serpent</i>
<ul>
<li>Something like an Indiana Jones adventure in a dark fantasy setting, it details the journey of a witch named Relia, and a half-serpentine princess named Syrene. They travel a land wracked by endless war, through ruins haunted by otherworldly shadow, dealing with themes of anxiety, the fear of death, and social exclusion.</li>
<li>Currently working on the second draft. Slowly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Along a Distant Star<br />
</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A military sci-fi story about a destroyer stranded after a bad FTL jump. The captain is killed, and command passes to the chief science officer, who is <em>not</em> ready to take command but has to figure something out. She also falls for the harsh chief tactical officer.</li>
<li>I'm just playing around with a first draft right now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>The Myrmidon</em>
<ul>
<li>This is more worldbuilding than an actual novel right now. It's based in a harsh, dark fantasy world and has a lot of similarities to the <em>Witcher</em> series.</li>
<li>So far I have one story out for beta readers, but I don't know if I'll wind up trying to publish it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is likely to changeÂ at any time, and I expect I'll make a blog post discussing what I'm changing, when I do.</p>
