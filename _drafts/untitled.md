This was originally a long Twitter thread, but I should probably stop doing those in favor of just writing them here. The Link's Awakening post was a lot of fun, so I guess I can do a vent about video games.

It's unfortunate how many great RPGs have incredibly boring opening acts. These are games that have been hyped to me for years, though not through any concrete means (such as concrete details about the plot and why I'd like it), vs. more abstract stuff like 'this is the best C/JRPG ever made ans you should play it.' And then I start, and I'm in a boring fantasy village for 12 hours you could almost skip entirely before the actual plot starts.

To start naming names: Baldur's Gate 1/2, Trails in the Sky, Pillars of Eternity. The Witcher games also apply, perhaps egregiously so, but I just don't like that setting or those characters at all and my god I'm fucking sick of hearing and them. But I want to focus on games I want to like, the ones listed above.

Like I said, these are games I've been recommended *for years*. The pinnacles of the genre. But inevitably when I start

To use BG2 as an example, it does expect you to have played the first game for you to care about these other characters caged in a magic laboratory. You're just given hints as to why.

I'm sure it's fascinating, but I don't want to play 30 hours before it becomes so.

I didn't get very far. As with everything else, the weight of people's hype and adoration for the late game overshadowed everything about the beginning. I don't want to scramble through sewers doing random sidequests with the vague hope it becomes better.

Contrast this with my favorite CRPG, Planescape: Torment, which immediately gives you an interesting hook, an interesting setting to explore (a mortuary, then Sigil), interesting party members (the first person you talk to is a wisecracking floating skull).

It's not even that I dislike these games. It'd be easier for me to drop them if so.

I WANT to like these games, a lot, and I have for years, but the reality of those early hours is so draining that the idea of playing until the good stuff is almost physically painful.
