<p>I'm Matt Velez, a writer currently living in the suburbs of Philadelphia. A native of New Jersey, I've bounced around both states a number of times in my life, finding myself somewhere along the way. A few years ago, I figured out writing was a heck of a lot more fun than everyone let on, and I've been doing it ever since.</p>
<p>I tend to write most about science fiction and fantasy, but I try not to stick to any particular subgenre. Whatever I write is what it is. I'm currently working on a few different novel ideas, and any number of smaller, shorter stories, at varying degrees of completion. Check out my <a href="http://mattvelez.net/projects/">Current Projects</a> page to see what I'm working on now, whenever 'now' might be.</p>
<p>Writing is my main passion in life, but it's hardly all I do. I work a day job in data manipulation for a nationwide company, and am looking into forging a career in web development to help fund my writingÂ hobby/obsession. When I'm not doing that, I'm an avid reader and gamer, whether by video or tabletop. Expect opinions on them.</p>
<p>I'll be using this blog for putting forward some of my ideas on storywriting and worldbuilding, or just whatever I feel like writing about at the time. For shorter snippets of nonsense, check out my <a href="http://twitter.com/mattvelez22">Twitter</a>.</p>
