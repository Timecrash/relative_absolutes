Wherein I detail whatever I'm working on right now.

This can change on a week by week basis, generally; I can be pretty scatterbrained when it comes to my writing. On the whole, though, there's a few major projects I'll be working on throughout the year, and those are:

## The Witch and the Serpent

Something like an Indiana Jones adventure in a dark fantasy setting, it details the journey of a witch named Relia, and a half-serpentine princess named Syrene. They travel a land wracked by endless war, through ruins haunted by otherworldly shadow, dealing with themes of anxiety, the fear of death, and social exclusion.

Currently working on the second draft. Slowly.

## Along a Distant Star

A military sci-fi story about a destroyer stranded after a bad FTL jump. The captain is killed, and command passes to the chief science officer, who is *not* ready to take command but has to figure something out. She also falls for the harsh chief tactical officer.

I'm just playing around with a first draft right now.

## The Myrmidon

This is more worldbuilding than an actual novel right now. It's based in a harsh, dark fantasy world.

So far I have one story out for beta readers, but I don't know if I'll wind up trying to publish it.

* * *

This list is likely to changeÂ at any time, and I expect I'll make a blog post discussing what I'm changing, when I do.
